<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The NetSpell project is a spell checking engine written entirely in managed 
C# .net code.&nbsp; NetSpell&#39;s suggestions 
for a misspelled word are generated using phonetic (sounds like) matching and ranked 
by a typographical (looks like) score.&nbsp; NetSpell supports multiple 
languages and the dictionaries are based on the OpenOffice Affix compression 
format. The library can be used in Windows or Web Form projects. The download 
includes an English dictionary with dictionaries for other languages available 
for download on the project web site. NetSpell also supports user added words 
and automatic creation of user dictionaries. It also includes a dictionary 
build tool to build custom dictionaries. </p>
<h2>The Dictionary</h2>
<p>The root of all spell checkers is a word list, aka the dictionary.&nbsp; The 
dictionary contains a list of common words for a 
language.&nbsp; For example, the US English dictionary that comes with this 
package contains 162,573 words.</p>
<p>When designing the dictionary for NetSpell I wanted the dictionary to be a 
single file, be 
as small as possible and load extremely fast. I experimented with many different 
ways to save and load the large word lists.&nbsp; Techniques I tried 
ranged from a saved dataset to a binary serialized collection, all of 
which proved to be too slow. I ended up using the good old UTF8 text file. 
Loading and parsing a text file proved to be extremely fast.</p>
<h2>Affix Compression</h2>
<p>The first issue I wanted to tackle was the file size.&nbsp; Any compression 
scheme would have to decompress really fast. I first tried using zip.&nbsp; 
While the dictionary loaded in the one second range, it was still not fast 
enough to be used in a web environment.</p>
<p>My research into spell checkers turned up a popular technique called Affix 
Compression.&nbsp; Affix Compression is using a base word and adding prefixes 
and suffixes to it to create other words.&nbsp; The affix compression scheme was 
originally developed by Geoff Kuenning for his ISpell spell checker. The 
OpenOffice project expanded the Affix Compression scheme to simplify its rule 
definitions.&nbsp; The NetSpell 
Affix implementation is largely based on the OpenOffice MySpell format.&nbsp; 
Read the following <a href="http://lingucomponent.openoffice.org/affix.readme">
link</a> to better understand Affix Compression format.</p>
<p>As a result of using the OpenOffice dictionary format, NetSpell dictionaries 
are easily created from OpenOffice dictionaries.&nbsp; This allows NetSpell to 
easily support additional languages.&nbsp; The NetSpell download includes a 
dictionary build tool that allows you to create new dictionaries.&nbsp; The 
build tool also allows you to import OpenOffice dictionaries and save them to 
the NetSpell format.</p>
<h2>Dictionary Sections</h2>
<p>To satisfy the goal of making the dictionary a single file, I needed a way to 
separate different sections of the file. This would allow for storing different types of data as a 
word list was not the only data need to be stored.&nbsp; I decided to use the INI section format. I thought about using XML but XML carries a large weight in 
terms of file size because of the use of tags.&nbsp; I ended up with the 
following sections in the file.</p>
<p><b>[Copyright]</b><br>
The Copyright section contains any copyright information about the word list for 
the particular dictionary. </p>
<p><b>[Try]</b> <br>
The try section contains a sequence of letters that are used to try to make a 
correct word out of a misspelled word. They should be listed on a single line in 
order of character frequency (highest to lowest).&nbsp; This section is used by 
the Near Miss Strategy discussed later.</p>
<p><b>[Replace]</b> <br>
The replace section contains a sequence of letter combinations that are often 
misspelled, for example ei and ie.&nbsp; The data is entered in this section in 
a <i>search characters</i> space <i>replace characters</i> format.&nbsp; The ei, 
ie example would look like this in the dictionary, &quot;ei ie&quot;. This section is used 
by the Near Miss Strategy discussed later.</p>
<p><b>[Prefix]</b><br>
The prefix section is used to define a set of affix rules for prefixes that can 
be attached to the beginning of a base word to form other words.&nbsp; The 
format of these rules follows the same format as OpenOffice's affix files except 
the PFX is removed. You can read more about the OpenOffice affix format
<a href="http://lingucomponent.openoffice.org/affix.readme">here</a></p>
<p><b>[Suffix]</b><br>
The suffix section is used to define a set of affix rules for suffixes that can 
be attached to the end of a base word to form other words.&nbsp; The format of 
suffix rules follows the same format as OpenOffice's affix files except the SFX 
is removed. You can read more about the OpenOffice affix format
<a href="http://lingucomponent.openoffice.org/affix.readme">here</a></p>
<p><b>[Phonetic]</b><br>
The phonetic section is optional and it contains a set of rules that define how 
to generate a phonetic code for a character or set of characters.&nbsp; The 
phonetic code is generated using Lawrence Philips' Metaphone Algorithm that has 
been adapted to a table format by the ASpell project.&nbsp; The NetSpell 
dictionary uses the same format that ASpell uses.&nbsp; ASpell phonetic maps can 
be used directly by NetSpell.&nbsp; See the following
<a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/download/aspell/manual/user/7_Adding.html#SECTION00830000000000000000">
link</a> to learn more about the ASpell phonetic code.</p>
<p><b>[Words]</b><br>
The words section is the list of base words for the dictionary.&nbsp; The 
format for this section is <i>word/affix keys/phonetic code</i>.&nbsp; The affix 
keys and phonetic code portions are optional.&nbsp; The affix keys portion 
indicates which affix rules apply to this word.&nbsp; The phonetic code portion 
is a cache of the phonetic code for this word and is used by the phonetic 
suggestion strategy.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Another important thing to know about dictionaries are that they are named to 
match the .net framework CultureInfo.Name property.&nbsp; For example the US 
English dictionary is named &quot;en-US.dic&quot;.&nbsp; The en-US match the 
CultureInfo.Name property.&nbsp; This allows the NetSpell library to default to 
the dictionary that corresponds to the computer's regional settings.</p>
<h2>Spell Checking Text</h2>
<p>Spell checking is normally performed by searching the dictionary for the given 
word.&nbsp; Now that we've implemented affix compression, searching for the word 
became more complicated.&nbsp; We have to create base words out of the given 
word. The process goes like this, first the base word list is searched for the 
given word.&nbsp; If the word is not found in the base word list, the suffix 
rules are removed from the word.&nbsp; After a suffix is removed, then the new 
word is checked to see if it is in the base word list.&nbsp; If the word is 
still not found, the same process is repeated for the prefixes. If the word 
can't be found after removing the suffixes and prefixes, then the word is not 
found in the dictionary and is most likely misspelled.</p>
<h2>Generating Suggestions</h2>
<p>Once it has been determined that the word is misspell, we need to generate 
suggestions for the correct spelling of that word.&nbsp; This is where the magic 
of a spell checker happens. NetSpell uses two different techniques to generate 
suggestions.&nbsp; The first was developed by Geoff Kuenning for ISpell and is 
commonly called the near miss strategy. The second is Lawrence Philips' 
Metaphone Algorithm which returns a code that is a rough approximation of how an 
English word sounds.</p>
<h2>Near Miss Strategy</h2>
<p>The near miss strategy is a fairly simple way to generate suggestions.&nbsp; 
Near miss takes the approach&nbsp;that the user didn't necessarily misspell the 
word but rather they mistyped it.&nbsp; Two words are considered near if 
they can be made identical by either inserting a blank space, interchanging two 
adjacent letter, changing one letter, deleting one letter or adding one letter. 
If a valid word is generated using these techniques, then it is added to the 
suggestion list. As you might have guessed, the near miss strategy doesn't 
provide the best list of suggestions when a word is truly misspelled.&nbsp; That 
is where the phonetic strategy kicks in. </p>
<h2>Phonetic Strategy</h2>
<p>To understand the phonetic strategy, phonetic code needs to be defined.&nbsp; 
A phonetic code is a rough approximation of how the word sounds.&nbsp; Each 
character in the code represents a sound.&nbsp; Its important to also understand 
that the phonetic code does not indicate how to pronounce the word, its only a 
representation of how it sounds.</p>
<p>The phonetic strategy is comparing the phonetic code of the misspelled word 
to all the words in the word list.&nbsp; If the phonetic codes match, then the 
word is added to the suggestion list.</p>
<p>While that process may sound strait forward, it becomes much more complicated 
when affix compression is introduced.&nbsp; An affix compressed word list only 
contains base words.&nbsp; We can't just compare the phonetic code of the 
misspelled word to the word list because the misspelled word may or may not be a 
base word.&nbsp; To solve this issue, we remove all affix rules that pass the 
conditions of the rule from the misspelled word and add the resulting string to 
a possible base word list.&nbsp; An important note to keep in mind is that the 
possible base word list is not a list of real words.&nbsp; It is only a list of 
strings that can be made by removing the affix rules from the misspelled word.</p>
<p>Now that we have a list of possible base words from the misspelled word, we 
can generate the phonetic code on them and compare those codes with the list of 
base words.&nbsp; If one of the codes match the base word code, we add that word 
to the list of suggestion.&nbsp; Since we removed all the affix keys and we 
compared only the base words, an expanded base word could be the correct word.&nbsp; 
So, we expand the base word that matched by applying all the affix rules to get 
a list of all the possible words from that base word. We then add that list to 
the suggestion list.</p>
<h2>Ranking Suggestions</h2>
<p>Once we have a list of suggestions, we need some way to rank them by the 
most likely to be the correct spelling. My research into the best way to go 
about this turned up the Edit Distance Algorithm.&nbsp; The edit distance is 
defined as the smallest number of insertions, deletions, and substitutions 
required to change one string into another. The NetSpell Edit Distance Algorithm 
implementation has one slight modification in that it adds an extra edit 
distance if the first character and last character don't match.&nbsp; The 
rational behind this is that people generally can get the first character and 
last character correct when trying to spell a word.</p>
<h2>Using the Library</h2>
<p>To use the NetSpell Library in your project you simply add a reference to 
NetSpell.SpellChecker.dll to the project.&nbsp; You can also add the library to 
the Visual Studio Toolbox to make it easier to interact with the properties. The 
library is event based so you have to handle the various events.&nbsp; Also, if 
you set the ShowDialog property to true, the library will using its internal 
suggestion form to display the suggestion when a MisspelledWord event occurs. </p>
<p>The following code is a very simple implementation of the NetSpell library.</p>
<pre lang="cs">
internal System.Windows.Forms.RichTextBox Document;
internal NetSpell.SpellChecker.Spelling SpellChecker;

// add event handlers
this.SpellChecker.MisspelledWord += 
    new NetSpell.SpellChecker.Spelling.MisspelledWordEventHandler(this.SpellChecker_MisspelledWord);
this.SpellChecker.EndOfText += 
    new NetSpell.SpellChecker.Spelling.EndOfTextEventHandler(this.SpellChecker_EndOfText);
this.SpellChecker.DoubledWord += 
    new NetSpell.SpellChecker.Spelling.DoubledWordEventHandler(this.SpellChecker_DoubledWord);

private void SpellChecker_DoubledWord(object sender, 
                                      NetSpell.SpellChecker.SpellingEventArgs args)
{
    // update text
    this.Document.Text = this.SpellChecker.Text;
}

private void SpellChecker_EndOfText(object sender, 
                                    System.EventArgs args)
{
    // update text
    this.Document.Text = this.SpellChecker.Text;
}

private void SpellChecker_MisspelledWord(object sender, 
                                         NetSpell.SpellChecker.SpellingEventArgs args)
{
    // update text
    this.Document.Text = this.SpellChecker.Text;
}

// Start Spell Checking
SpellChecker.Text = this.Document.Text;
SpellChecker.SpellCheck();

</pre>
<p lang="cs">The project download includes two example application for the 
NetSpell Library.&nbsp; The first is a Windows forms text editor.&nbsp; The 
second is a web project that demonstrats using the library in a web enviroment.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The NetSpell project has been a fun and challenging project to work on.&nbsp; 
I plan to continue to improve and add new features to the library.&nbsp; The 
feature that I'm currently working on is real time spell checking, like MS Word.&nbsp; 
Please feel free to contact me with any suggestions, bug reports and feature 
request.</p>
